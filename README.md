# led-and-button
A simple button controlled LED project by using PIC16F877 and CCS C compiler.
I've used PIC16F877 microchip, 4 LEDs and a button. I've used Altium Designer for creating the schematic.  The operation is very basic, If you press the button the LEDs will blink in a specific order, 
otherwise the blink order will change.
